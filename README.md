# What is JSON to Field?
Many Integrations and applications like Salesforce Vlocity store JSON in sObject fields, often when you want to use data from that JSON you need it to be in standard sObject fields in Salesforce, this means a developer often has to write some code to deserialise the JSON and take JSON values and put them into Salesforce fields. This Utility does exactly that in a generic way allowing users to declaratively manage field mappings.
